=head2 CreateReportParams

=over 4



=item Description

Parameters used to create a more complex report with file and html links

        The following arguments allow the user to specify the classical data fields in the report object:
string message - simple text message to store in report object
list <WorkspaceObject> objects_created;
list <string> warnings - a list of warning messages in simple text

The following argument allows the user to specify the location of html files/directories that the report widget will render <or> link to:
list <fileRef> html_links - a list of paths or shock node IDs pointing to a single flat html file or to the top level directory of a website

The report widget can render one html view directly. Set one of the following fields to decide which view to render:
string html_string - simple html text that will be rendered within the report widget
int  direct_link_array_ref - use this to specify the index of the page in html_links to view directly in the report widget (ignored if html_string is set)

The following argument allows the user to specify the location of files that the report widget should link for download:
list <fileRef> file_links - a list of paths or shock node IDs pointing to a single flat file

The following parameters indicate where the report object should be saved in the workspace:
string report_object_name - name to use for the report object (job ID is used if left unspecified)
string workspace_name - name of workspace where object should be saved
